    <h4><b>Opinion Piece: Thoughts on “Patient-Centered Care"</b><em class="subtitle"><br>Anson Tong<br>April 2019</em>
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>One of healthcare’s favorite terms is “patient-centered care,” a departure from the traditional idea of listening
      and trusting what your doctor says without question. In many aspects, this is great. It accounts for individual
      preferences, gives the patient a voice to advocate for themselves, raise questions, and take responsibility for
      their care. In our current model, it’s much more acceptable to seek second or third opinions and have a real
      dialogue with your doctor before proceeding. We are acknowledging the patient’s role and encouraging engagement.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>There are also potential issues with this approach that must be acknowledged and considered so that we can avoid
      them. Ultimately, the physician knows a lot more and has more experience in this domain, and their advice should
      carry more weight than other sources. There is a difference between being an active participant in your healthcare
      and being unnecessarily distrustful or weighing information inaccurately. Some things are medical facts. As the
      relentless anti-vaccination movement and its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/" target="_blank">numerous
        measles outbreaks</a> show, there are dangerous consequences to ignoring accepted medical knowledge.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another issue with this paradigm shift is the fact that an increasing share of the burden is placed on patients
      regarding their health. The “last mile” of healthcare delivery (e.g. scheduling appointments, actually taking the
      medication prescribed, etc.) is indeed up to the patient, but as we choose to move our attention and focus
      squarely on the patient and patient-centered interventions, we neglect broader systemic issues. This ties my
      thoughts to another one of the healthcare terms of the moment, “social determinants of health.” A patient would
      almost certainly struggle to self-advocate and follow a doctor’s instructions if they are facing profound
      financial strain, the stress and sometimes even cultural stigma of being ill, etc. Why hasn’t transparency about
      cost or physician conflicts of interest been integrated in patient-centered care? What about considerations
      regarding the trade-off between patient satisfaction and physician burnout? Working to improve quality of care
      requires the cooperation of patients, physicians, entire health systems, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and
      policymakers. If we allow any player to go unscrutinized and unsupported, the disparities in healthcare will only
      continue to widen.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Recently, I started volunteering with Houston Empowering Refugees, which is a project focusing on empowering
      Afghan refugee women and educating them about health resources in Houston. Compared to other refugee populations,
      Afghani women experience a higher rate of domestic abuse and much of this is ignored due to the fact that refugee
      women do not know of the resources they can utilize. Through Houston Empowering Refugees, we hold weekly health
      education classes revolving around a variety of different topics such as child nutrition, birth control, and
      different forms of exercise.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Through this experience, I have seen how excited the refugee women are to learn more about health resources and
      integrating further into the Houston community. This experience has also taught me that health disparities exist
      almost everywhere, and it is important to take initiative to combat these by helping these underserved populations
      through different platforms.</p>

    <h4><b>MedHum Recommends: <em>Illness as Metaphor</em></b><em class="subtitle"><br>Naimah Sarwar<br>February
        2019</em></h4>
    <p>In her work, <em>Illness as Metaphor</em>, Susan Sontag contrasts the social metaphors associated with
      tuberculosis and those associated with cancer. Tuberculosis was the disease of the poets and artists. It
      romanticized the frailty and gaunt appearance that was a result of the disease’s symptoms and was associated with
      passion, youth and the elite. Cancer, on the other hand, was characterized as this demonic or alien force that
      took over the body. It was characterized with growth or a cancerous “pregnancy” of sorts that was difficult to
      aestheticize.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While tuberculosis was associated with the passion and a heightened experience of the worldly, cancer was
      associated with the limitation of the appreciation of worldly life. Sontag also explores the connections of cancer
      as a metaphor with roots in the political and social climate. She outlines the militaristic nature of cancer
      treatment as a kind of guerilla warfare. The aggressive nature of the disease led to the cancer metaphor’s
      translation into twentieth century politics in particular. Political turmoil and even genocides have been
      attributed to rhetoric labelling the “other” as a cancer in need of eradication.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sontag’s exploration of metaphors goes beyond exploration of an illness. What does it mean to be ill? Why don’t
      we perceive all illnesses equally? Why do place different expectations on patients with different illnesses?
      Illness as Metaphor reflects on these questions and how the evolution of their answers tells us something
      meaningful about society at large. It’s a short yet fascinating read that grants a fresh perspective on medicine
      and illness.

    <p> “Illness is the night side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in
      the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use the good passport, sooner or
      later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place.”<br><b>―

    <h4><b>Objectivity &amp; Anatomy</b><em class="subtitle"><br>Bilal Rehman<br>February 2019</em></h4>
    <img src="img/blog/bilal_1.jpg" alt="de Carpi">
    <p>I recently worked on a project with Dr. John Mulligan that involved photographing anatomy
      atlases from the 16th and 17th centuries. The artistic developments of the Renaissance
      interplayed in a complex way with the drive for scientific objectivity in depictions of the body.
      The first image [above], from the early 16th century (da Carpi), is two-dimensional and lacking in
      detail. The figure depicted reveals his own body to the viewer.
    </p>
    <img src="img/blog/bilal_2.jpg" alt="Cesare">
    <p>The second image (early 17th century, Cesare) strikes a sort of balance between the first and
      third images — the baby still seems to be self-revealing, and both the artistic and scientific
      quality of the depiction is much better than that of the da Carpi drawing.
    </p>
    <img src="img/blog/bilal_3.jpg" alt="Bidloo">
    <p>The third image, from the late 17th century (Bidloo), is the most apparently scientific. The head
      is seen on the dissecting table, and page by page throughout the atlas, Bidloo depicts the peeling
      back of each layer of the body. Images in anatomy textbooks most resemble the third image,
      though depictions of the body today are abstracted from any artistic or physical form in the hopes
      of structural clarity.
